# Discover Feature Engineering, How to Engineer Features and How to Get Good at It

Feature engineering is an informal topic, but one that is absolutely known and agreed to be key to success in applied machine learning.

In creating this guide I went wide and deep and synthesized all of the material I could.

You will discover what feature engineering is, what problem it solves, why it matters, how to engineer features, who is doing it well and where you can go to learn more and get good at it.

If you read one article on feature engineering, I want it to be this one.

> feature engineering is another topic which doesn’t seem to merit any review papers or books, or even chapters in books, but it is absolutely vital to ML success. […] Much of the success of machine learning is actually success in engineering features that a learner can understand.
